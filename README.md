# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This is a website that generates random Romance books. You can save the randomly generated books, or add your own custom book based on data that you enter. The HTML and CSS of this project was alreayd provided to us, so the actual work that was done was all Javascript.

### Installation Instructions:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
Over the course of three and a half days, we spent around seven hours total on the project. We are currently in Mod 1 of Turing, Week 2.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The goals of the project was to collaborate with other students on a project and work together. This was on top of practicing the Javascript skills that we've built from Mod 0 till now. We did have to teach ourselves certain things like how Event Objects work, and how to create elements in the DOM with only Javascript.

### Wins + Challenges:
